# Interview Questions: Undirected Graphs

## Nonrecursive depth-first search

**Question**. Implement depth-first search in an undirected graph without using recursion.

**Answer**.

## Diameter and center of a tree

**Question**. Given a connected graph with no cycles

- Diameter: design a linear-time algorithm to find the longest simple path in the graph.
- Center: design a linear-time algorithm to find a vertex such that its maximum distance from any other vertex is minimized.

**Answer**.

## Euler cycle

**Question**. An Euler cycle in a graph is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that uses every edge in the graph exactly one. Show that a connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree. Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a graph has an Euler cycle, and if so, find one.

**Answer**.
