## Prefix free codes

**Question**. In data compression, a set of binary strings is if no string is a prefix of another. For example, {01,10,0010,1111} is prefix free, but {01,10,0010,10100} is not because 10 is a prefix of 10100. Design an efficient algorithm to determine if a set of binary strings is prefix-free. The running time of your algorithm should be proportional the number of bits in all of the binary stings.

## Boggle

**Question**. Boggle is a word game played on an 44-by-44 grid of tiles, where each tile contains one letter in the alphabet. The goal is to find all words in the dictionary that can be made by following a path of adjacent tiles (with no tile repeated), where two tiles are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
